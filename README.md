# Smart-Home-System

This project implements a **Smart Home System** powered by the **PIC16F877A microcontroller**, integrating various sensors, actuators, and user interfaces to demonstrate automated home functionalities. The system is designed to provide enhanced convenience, security, and energy efficiency through:<br>
**-Password-protected door access control** using a keypad and servo motor.<br>
**-Automatic lighting control** triggered by an ultrasonic sensor.<br>
**-Temperature-based fan control** using a KY-026 flame sensor and H-bridge.<br>
**-Real-time system feedback** through an LCD display.<br>
The project showcases how embedded systems can integrate seamlessly with smart home technologies to create an efficient, automated environment.
